# TLFINet : Lightweight Steel Surface Defect Detection based on Texture-Guided Learning and Feature Interaction
- This research on TLFINet is valuable for steel surface defect detection. It solves problems faced by traditional and existing methods. TLFINet outperforms other lightweight algorithms in accuracy, complexity, and real-time performance.

# TODOs
- [x] Release training code.
- [x] Release inference code.
- [ ] Release pretrained models.
